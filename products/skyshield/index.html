        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to SkyShield, the powerful antivirus software designed to protect your digital world. Developed by BrightSky OSSDO, SkyShield is a robust security solution crafted with user-centricity in mind. We believe that cybersecurity is a fundamental right, which is why SkyShield is completely free to download and use to its fullest extent. We are committed to providing top-notch protection without any financial barriers.</p>

        <h1>Unleashing the Power of SkyShield</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>SkyShield was created using the industry-standard Microsoft Visual Studio and written in C#, leveraging the Windows Forms framework. Our dedicated team has poured their expertise into developing an antivirus solution that combines reliability, efficiency, and ease of use.</p>

        <h1>Three Essential Scans</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>SkyShield offers three comprehensive scanning options to ensure every corner of your system is safeguarded against potential threats:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Quick Scan</b>: This rapid scan targets the most vulnerable directories where viruses often lurk, including the Downloads folder, Program Files folder, and AppData folder. In just 20 seconds, SkyShield's Quick Scan provides a swift yet thorough assessment of your system's security.</li>
            <li><b>Full System Scan</b>: For a more extensive analysis, SkyShield's Full System Scan meticulously examines your entire C: drive. While it currently focuses on the C: drive exclusively, we are continuously improving SkyShield and plan to introduce support for additional drives in future updates. Despite its comprehensive nature, the Full System Scan typically completes within approximately 100 seconds, ensuring a minimal impact on your productivity.</li>
            <li><b>Custom Scan</b>: With the Custom Scan feature, you have the flexibility to manually select any folder on your computer for targeted virus detection. While we are aware of a minor bug that may occur when scanning directories without files but with subfolders, there is a simple workaround to ensure a seamless scanning experience. By creating a blank file within the directory, you can successfully initiate the scan and protect all subfolders contained within. The duration of the Custom Scan varies based on the size and complexity of the folder, but it generally completes swiftly.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h1>Enhanced Protection Features</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>SkyShield goes beyond traditional antivirus capabilities, offering two additional features to fortify your digital security:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Real Time Protection</b>: Keep your system safe in real time. With Real Time Protection enabled, SkyShield works diligently in the background, even when you exit the software. It scans files as they are downloaded, providing immediate alerts if any potential dangers are detected. Stay one step ahead of threats with this vital layer of defense.</li>
            <li><b>Firewall</b>: Safeguard your network with SkyShield's built-in firewall. Protecting against unauthorized access, our firewall secures the network you're connected to without requiring any additional permissions or network password entries. Please note that running SkyShield's firewall simultaneously with Windows Defender firewall may result in conflicts, so we recommend using only one firewall at a time.</li>
        </ol>
