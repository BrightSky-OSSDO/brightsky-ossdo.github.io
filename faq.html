    </center>
    <h2>How much do your products cost? I can't find a pricing page.</h2>
    <p>All our products are free and open-source, which means you can access and use them without any cost. We believe in providing accessible and high-quality software to our users, which is why we don't have a pricing page.</p>
    <h2>How do I contact you for support?</h2>
    <p>We offer multiple avenues for support. You can tag us on <a href="https://twitter.com/BrightSky_OSSDO">X</a>, send us an <a href="mailto:help.brightsky@gmail.com">email</a>, or post your queries on our official <a href="https://new.reddit.com/r/BrightSky">subreddit</a>. We strive to provide timely and helpful assistance to our users through these channels.</p>
    <h2>Do you have a physical store where I can see the products?</h2>
    <p>As our products are software and online tools, we do not have a physical store. Since our offerings are digital in nature, there are no physical items to showcase or sell. However, you can access and explore our products directly through our website.</p>
    <h2>How can I unsubscribe from your newsletter or marketing emails?</h2>
    <p>To unsubscribe from our newsletter or marketing emails, simply send us an <a href="mailto:help.brightsky@gmail.com">email</a> expressing your preference not to receive our release updates. We respect your choices and will promptly remove you from our mailing list upon receiving your request.</p>
    <h2>When will BrightSky OS 1.0 be released?</h2>
    <p><a href="http://brightsky-os.000webhostapp.com">BrightSky OS</a>, our flagship operating system, is currently in the beta phase, offering limited features and known issues. We anticipate the full release, version 1.0, to be available either later in 2024 or sometime in 2025. We're continuously working to refine and enhance the OS to ensure a stable and feature-rich experience for our users.</p>
    <h2>Are your websites safe? </h2>
    <p>Yes, our websites are safe to use. While it's possible that some of our websites may not have SSL certificates, it doesn't mean they are inherently unsafe. We prioritize user safety and take necessary precautions to ensure the security of our platforms and user data.</p>
