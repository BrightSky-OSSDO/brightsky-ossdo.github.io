We're continuously working to refine and enhance the OS to ensure a stable and feature-rich experience for our users.</p>
    <h2>Are your websites safe?</h2>

We strive to eliminate the barriers that restrict access to cutting-edge technology and promote a world where technological advancement is a universal right. Additionally, we do not display ads on our websites as we want to provide a clean and user-friendly experience without any unnecessary distractions.</p>
    <h2>You said that your products are open-source. Where can I find the source code?</h2>
    <p>We are actively working on making the source code for our products available to the public. We plan to post the source code on GitHub within the next few months. Once the repositories are set up, we will provide links to each repository on the appropriate webpage, allowing users to access and explore the source code.</p>
    <h2>Will BrightSky OS 1.0 introduce any new file extensions?</h2>

    <h2>Why is USIARC not loading? I received a 403 error when I attempted to navigate to it.</h2>
    <p>We apologize for the inconvenience. USIARC, which stands for Universal Space Information and Research Corporation, is a wiki dedicated to providing reliable information about space. Unfortunately, the original domain where it was hosted became inaccessible due to unknown reasons. We are actively working on creating a new version of USIARC on Fandom, which we hope will provide a more reliable and accessible platform for space-related information.</p>
